Within the comments of my Chromecast [post](https://plus.google.com/110558071969009568835/posts/ZeHgRXS6AZs) last week, there were quite a few people defending the product saying, "For $35, it does what it is advertised to do."

That observation also applies to your Android phone: For $600, your Android does what it is advertised to do. It makes calls, plays music, gets on the internet, ships with an outdated version of Android (which never sees updates), and provides a tired user experience.

Yet, over the Android phone, those same commenters will start change.org petitions, participate in tweet campaigns, and create a general rabble in the hopes of influencing the not-Google-manufacturer to unlock the phone and make it as open as possible.

Sure, the Chromecast does what it is advertised to do. But that's not interesting to me. I'm interested in seeing what the Chromecast can do, that wasn't advertised.
