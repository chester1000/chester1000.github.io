tl;wr: They're both bad and the're both good. No conclusions.

#### Intro(?)

This article is a vary general analysis of how both systems evolved. I'm not attempting to analize in-depth how those systems evolved, because it already exist ([Android](arstechnica?), [iOS](anything exists?)).



This article isn't going to be a feature-by-feature comparison of both mobile systems or an in-depth history of them, but rather a general description af the way they were evolving.


#### Beginnings

##### Android

* candy for developers (open-source freaks; free as in freedom), interesting solutions,
* pack as many features as possible, despite terrible UI/UX,
* A lot of dev materials for a very early android versions (hard to deal problem now),
* terrible for end users (slow, laggy, unreliable, ugly, chunky, non-functional, terrible UX),
* All imaginable form factors allowed,
* catching up with UX/UI
  * years of handheld/mobile experience to build on top of,
  * tons of products to test on,
  * dogfood,
  * platform UI unification (almost the same guidelines for mobile, tablets, web, tvs, watches, phablets, cars, glasses)
  * lowest level differ though
    * currently:
      * Java on mobile
      * JS in Chrome[OS]
      * PHP/Python/Java/Go on server

    * future:
     * dart/Go/Java on mobile
     * dart/JS in Chrome[OS]
     * any on server


##### iOS

* candy for end users (UX ond UI literally from the future),
* better to skip features than deliver them poorly,
* not very hackable: block all Jail Break attempts, sue developers,
* closed source, API, lack of development transparency, no detailed changelogs, no social media announcements, no access to core developers,
* control as much as possible (App Store submitting process, replicating core apps functionality not allowed, removal of not wanted apps [Bitcoin]),
* small amount of form factors,
* catching up with low-level:
  * changes not visible to end users directly (except when things break),
  * rebuilding scalability (@2) models to fit other form factors,
  * each device is a completely different form factor/UX (phone, tablet, watch, etc) with a different developmont process,
  * new programming language Swift


  Maybe Google/Apple instead?
