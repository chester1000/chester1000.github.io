Leading up to the release of the HTC One, I was quite excited. From the early photos I'd seen of it, the production quality and attention to detail
on the industrial design seemed rival that of Apple's iPhone. Of course, I was pleased by the hardware specs, but that is only a minor improvement
over the current and coming offerings of the market.

# Hardware

Hardware is becoming commoditized, at least relatively to the software running on it. Two years ago, all the OEMs were blazing a trail, obsoleting their own
products within a matter months. This is quite similar to the PC era circa 10-15 years ago, where every manufacturer was vying to have more megahertz and gigabits.
Now, most consumers probably don't even care about the specs on their PC so much as the price point. For every day user needs, even the _slowest_ PC
is fast enough.

Hardware innovation outpacing software complexity is following suit on mobile devices-- even the mid tier phones can run the Android OS and apps just fine.
And the hardware differentiation at the top end of the mobile phone spectrum is minimal as well. Going forward, software and services will become the
value add on top of a OEM's offering.


My point is, I don't feel the hardware specs really set phones apart from each other anymore. That said, the HTC One still manages to set itself apart from
the other offerings currently on the market by boasting a dazzling 1080p display. I'm also geeking out with the on board TV Remote (powered by Peel).

In short, the hardware is incredible, and easily the best of breed on the market. But it is only an interative improvement over the Nexus 4 and nearly
exactly the same as the Samsung Galaxy S4.
