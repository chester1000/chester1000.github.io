This is a series of posts that highlights The Great and not-so-great parts of the IT industry.

### [Cool] <small>Facebook</small> [Messenger][fb_web] <small>[<i class="mdi mdi-google-play"></i>][fb_play] [<i class="mdi mdi-apple"></i>][fb_apple]</small>

Let's get it out of the picture first: I don't like Facebook. I don't like it at all, okay? I hate their stance on privacy. I think that [facebook.com][fb] interface looks like it wasn't updated for a decade now. I frequently don't agree with choices they've made (in their [techno][hhvm]-[logies][react], [purchases][fb_buys_oculus] or even [the vision itself][fb_privacy]). On top of that you can frequently hear me ~~bitching~~ expressing my opinion on how awful it is.


### [Dull] [Hangouts][hangouts_web] <small>[<i class="mdi mdi-google-play"></i>][hangouts_play] [<i class="mdi mdi-apple"></i>][hangouts_apple] [<i class="mdi mdi-google-chrome"></i>][hangouts_app] [<i class="mdi mdi-google-chrome"></i>][hangouts_ext]</small>

I remember times when most of my communication was happening on Google Talk/Hangouts. I remember times when it was The Way to communicate online, those times are over, and it's sad AF.


#### Sooooo slooooow

This product is so ridiculously and awfully slow, that I frequently forget what I was supposed to do there before it loads.


#### Notifications

Hangouts being an app made by Google, one would expect it would have notifications polished to perfection, but nope - they suck terribly, terribly bad.


#### One image at a time

Need to send 10 pictures? Well, you're out of luck.


#### Zero video at a time

Yes, Hangouts **does not** support sending videos at all.


#### Confusing calls buttons

**Q:** What happens when you click the voice call button above the conversation?<br>
**A:** In my experience: randomly calls the other person either via hangouts or their cell number.


#### SMS

It's just fundamentally broken, mkay.

* No sync
* Makes hangouts even slower


#### Stickers

I know it's a matter of taste, but those stickers are just ugly, they don't carry emotions properly, none of them are "cute", you can't identify with them, you can't add custom packs. It's just better to never use them.


#### No API

I get it Google, we have plenty choices, and you don't want us to have an inferior experience. BUT all the choices you give us are inferior in the first place.

Remember times when we were able to use Google Talk via XMPP/Jabber in all those funny little messengers, and some of them were even CLI-based? I do too, and I guess that's why seeing what happens to Hangouts now is so sad and disappointing.


### Broken consistently everywhere

Don't get me wrong, I'm not only talking about Hangouts for Android! It is fundamentally broken on every single interface I happened to use it on


#### Chrome OSX [app][hangouts_app]

I get it, it's really hard to implement _"chat-heads"_-like esthetic on OSX, but if you can give me an OK experience I'd be fine, but...

I've heard you like checking checkboxes, so new you can un-check your "Always On Top"¹ checkbox after every app reload?

<small>¹ - Nope, I don't know why every word is capitalized either.</small>


#### Chrome OSX [Extension][hangouts_ext]

##### The invisible, low-resolution icon

Can you spot the icon here?

#### Dedicated [web interface][hangouts_web]

Facebook Messenger has a [great web interface][fb_web]¹ I'm using, I would be totally fine with one more pinned tab, but...

It opens conversations in those teeny tiny windows. WHY‽

<small>¹ - Seriously, check it out it's great!</small>


### Good

* Video conferences
* Emoji
* "Where are you"
